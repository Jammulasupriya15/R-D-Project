Topic Modelling is a unsupervised Machine leaning technique that uses Natural Language Processing techniques to model unstructured documents. 
Techniques used:
Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA).
Typical system include a preprocessing unit, a random topic selection and algorithms for finding topic percentage in documents.Libraries used:Numpy used for various mathematical and array manipulation that are essential for implementing Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
sklearn used to normalize the topic-term and document-topic matrices,SciPy for performing Singular Value Decomposition.
